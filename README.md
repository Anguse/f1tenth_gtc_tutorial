### What is F1/10 Autonomous Racing?

F1/10 is an international autonomous racing competition which exposes the participants to the foundations of perception, planning and control in a fun, and challenging environment. Participating teams race vehicles with similar hardware specification and try to outsmart, and outpace each other in a battle of algorithms. Weâ€™re bringing together two dozen of the top research labs and tech institutions from around the world who have built F1/10 till date.

Few things focus the mind and excite the spirit like a competition. In the early days of racing, competitors first had to build their vehicles before they could race them. It was thus as much an engineering as a racing competition. We want to rekindle that competitive spirit for autonomous systems.
