### What is F1/10 Autonomous Racing?

F1/10 is an international autonomous racing competition which exposes the participants to the foundations of perception, planning and control in a fun, and challenging environment. Participating teams race vehicles with similar hardware specification and try to outsmart, and outpace each other in a battle of algorithms. Weâ€™re bringing together two dozen of the top research labs and tech institutions from around the world who have built F1/10 till date.

Few things focus the mind and excite the spirit like a competition. In the early days of racing, competitors first had to build their vehicles before they could race them. It was thus as much an engineering as a racing competition. We want to rekindle that competitive spirit for autonomous systems.

## Tutorial Summary:
- F1/10 Gazebo racing simulator
- Perception - LIDAR, and Camera - in Rviz
- Simple Navigation - Wall following and PID steering and velocity control
- Simulataneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using Hector SLAM
- Building and saving maps with LIDAR scan data
- Localization using the Adaptive Monte Carlo (AMCL) method
- Path planning and waypoint navigation using Time-Elastic Band (TEB) local planner.


## F1/10 Hardware Testbed Summary
### Note: Hardware testbed is not required for this tutorial

![](assets/images/testbed.png)

The F1/10 platform is designed to meet the following requirements:

1. The platform must be able to capture the  dynamics  of  a  full  scaled  autonomous car;  
2.  The platform's hardware and software stack must be modular so as to enable easy upgrades, maintenance and repairs and
3. The platform must be self-sustaining in terms of power, computation and sensors, i.e., it need not use any external localization

The testbed contains the following hardware:

* 1/10 scale rally racecar chassis with Ackerman steering from Traxxas
* Hokuyo 10LX LIDAR rangefinder
* Nvidia Jetson TX2 module
* Orbitty carrier for TX2
* ZED depth camera
* Vedder Electronic Speed Controller (VESC)
* MPU-9050inertial measurement unit (IMU)
* Ubiquiti Wifi Pico station access point

Detailed instructions on how to assemble the testbed are available on our [website](f1tenth.org)

## Installing
Based on the current configuration of your computer, you will have to install more than just the F1/10 package

### 1. Install ROS
If your computer dos not have ROS already installed, you can do so by following the instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu). Choose the 'desktop-full' install option as we will use the navigation libraries and visualization tools.
### 2. Create local workspace

You have to create a local directory to contain the F1/10 and its dependent packages and permanently source them. To do this, open a new terminal and do the following:

```console
user@computer:$ mkdir -p catkin_ws/src/
user@computer:$ cd catkin_ws/src/
user@computer:$ catkin_init_workspace
user@computer:$ cd ~/catkin_ws
user@computer:$ catkin_make
user@computer:$ echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Install F1/10 package and its dependencies

1. Install navigation libraries using apt-get
You have to install certain navigation libraries and some additional packages to support the simulator. You can do this by opening a new terminal and typing:
```console
user@computer:$ sudo apt-get -y install ros-melodic-control*
user@computer:$ sudo apt-get -y install ros-melodic-gazebo*
user@computer:$ sudo apt-get -y install ros-melodic-navigation*
user@computer:$ sudo apt-get -y install ros-melodic-teb-local-planner*
user@computer:$ sudo apt-get -y install ros-melodic-serial*
```
The * trailing the commands install the packages using the same name that are some times dependent on the master package.

2. Install mapping and core package using catkin_make
With all the dependencies installed, you can now install the F1/10 core package (with the simulator) and the rest of the packages necessary to run the nodes locally.

```console
user@computer:$ cd catkin_ws/src/
user@computer:$ git clone https://github.com/linklab-uva/f1tenth.git
user@computer:$ git clone https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_slam.git
user@computer:$ git clone https://github.com/mit-racecar/vesc.git
user@computer:$ cd ~/catkin_ws
user@computer:$ catkin_make install
```

## Getting Started

The F1/10 package complements the hardware by emulating its modular properties. The repository has been setup to help the user get started with the simulator out-of-the box. This section provides a quick dive into the three main sections of the tutorial;

The simulation sub-package contains one-line commands that perform these tasks parallelly, but we recommend that first-time users understand the processes before using these commands. If you are already experienced in ROS, the launch files are present under '/simulator/launch' directory.

### Introduction to the F1/10 simulator

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch racecar_gazebo racecar.launch
```

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch console keyboard_teleop.launch
```

### Basic navigation priciples (follw the inner wall)

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch racecar_gazebo racecar_simplerun.launch
```

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch simulator simple_run.launch
```

### Mapping a closed environment using Hector Mapping

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch racecar_gazebo racecar.launch
```

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch console keyboard_teleop.launch
```

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch platform mapping.launch
```

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch console mapping.launch
```

```console
user@computer:$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f <name_for_your_map>
```

### Advanced navigation using the TEB local planner

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch racecar_gazebo racecar.launch
```

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch platform navigation.launch
```

```console
user@computer:$ roslaunch console navigation.launch
```
